# Improving Data Visualizations
I used Willian S. Cleveland's principles of plotting in order to improve a data visualization I found online.

## Principles of Good Visualizations
### Improving Vision
- Reducing clutter
- Use visually prominent data elements
- Use proper scale lines and a data rectangle
- Be careful with reference lines, labels, notes, and keys

### Improving Understanding
- Provide explanations and draw conclusions
- Use all available space
- Align juxtaposed plots
- Use log scales when appropriate
- Bank to 45 degrees

## Tools Used
- D3.js
